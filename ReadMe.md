## DevOpsCamp initiative

The start point for this repository was a DevOpsCamp initiative run by my former work colleagues. The idea behind that was to get as much experience as possible through a set of digital training and hands-on activities. All of that with help of mentors and with an assessment at the end. 

With the "second iteration" when I tried to extend code and description with what I learned later on, I found no reason to change repository name. So it is as it is :smile:

All the documents are **NO manuals** - simply tells what I did and how. It is more like my notes with links to manuals, web pages etc. Just to keep it in one place in case I will need it in future.

If you are reading this - I hope this will be at least a bit useful for you.

Enjoy !
