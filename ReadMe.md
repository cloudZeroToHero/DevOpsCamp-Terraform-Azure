## DevOpsCamp initiative

The start point for this repository was a DevOpsCamp initiative - a set of digital training and hands-on activity (and assessment ) to get as much experience as possible. Some topics are for me completely new, so please be indulgent :smile:

All the documents are **NO manuals** - simply tells what I did and how. It is more like my notes from with links to manuals, web pages etc to keep it in case I will need it in future

I hope reading this will be at least a bit useful for you.

Enjoy !
